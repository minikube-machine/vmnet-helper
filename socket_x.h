 * recvmsg_x() is a system call similar to recvmsg(2) to receive
 * several datagrams at once in the array of message headers "msgp".
 *
 * recvmsg_x() can be used only with protocols handlers that have been specially
 * modified to support sending and receiving several datagrams at once.
 *
 * The size of the array "msgp" is given by the argument "cnt".
 *
 * The "flags" arguments supports only the value MSG_DONTWAIT.
 *
 * Each member of "msgp" array is of type "struct msghdr_x".
 *
 * The "msg_iov" and "msg_iovlen" are input parameters that describe where to
 * store a datagram in a scatter gather locations of buffers -- see recvmsg(2).
 * On output the field "msg_len" gives the length of the received datagram.
 *
 * The field "msg_flags" must be set to zero on input. On output, "msg_flags"
 * may have MSG_TRUNC set to indicate the trailing portion of the datagram was
 * discarded because the datagram was larger than the buffer supplied.
 * recvmsg_x() returns as soon as a datagram is truncated.
 *
 * recvmsg_x() may return with less than "cnt" datagrams received based on
 * the low water mark and the amount of data pending in the socket buffer.
 *
 * recvmsg_x() returns the number of datagrams that have been received,
 * or -1 if an error occurred.
 *
 * NOTE: This a private system call, the API is subject to change.
